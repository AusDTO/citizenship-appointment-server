- `USER_ID_x`: ID of API user `x`

#### Other

- `SESSION_JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_BASE64`: 256-bit Base64 encoded encryption and signature key for storing the user's security context in a cookie
- `CERTIFICATE_FINGERPRINT_SHA256_BASE64`: Base64 encoded SHA-256 fingerprint of the public key certificate of the public host, used for [HPKP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Security/Public_Key_Pinning), optional
- `ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID`: Analytics tracking ID, may be left blank
- `SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password for the read-only monitoring endpoints

##### Commands

Get fingerprint of public key certificate as a Base64 encoded SHA-265 digest of the DER formatted Subject Public Key Info (SPKI): 

    openssl x509 -pubkey -inform PEM -in certificate.pem -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64

### Running the application

To simply run the application:

    ./gradlew run
    
You can optionally supply the port number to use as an environment variable:

    PORT=8080 ./gradlew run

The port defaults to 8083. Use `PORT=0` to select a random port.
