# citizenship-appointment-server [![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AusDTO/citizenship-appointment-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AusDTO/citizenship-appointment-server)

This is the server code for the citizenship appointment service.  

The client code can be found in this repository: [AusDTO/citizenship-appointment-client](https://github.com/AusDTO/citizenship-appointment-client)

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Java 8

### Environment variables

A number of environment variables must be set to run the application

#### Service endpoints

- `SERVICE_ADDRESS_APPOINTMENT_TYPE`: HTTP(S) endpoint for the `svcAppointmentType` SOAP service
- `SERVICE_ADDRESS_CALENDAR`: HTTP(S) endpoint for the `svcCalendar` SOAP service
- `SERVICE_ADDRESS_CUSTOMER`: HTTP(S) endpoint for the `svcCustomer` SOAP service
- `SERVICE_ADDRESS_PROCESS`: HTTP(S) endpoint for the `svcProcess` SOAP service
- `SERVICE_ADDRESS_SERVICE`: HTTP(S) endpoint for the `svcService` SOAP service
- `SERVICE_ADDRESS_UNIT`: HTTP(S) endpoint for the `svcUnit` SOAP service
- `SERVICE_ADDRESS_USER`: HTTP(S) endpoint for the `svcAppUser` SOAP service

#### API users

At least one set of API user credentials must be supplied. `x` is a sequential number starting from `1`.

- `USER_USERNAME_x`: Username of API user `x` 
- `USER_PASSWORD_x`: Password of API user `x`
- `USER_ID_x`: ID of API user `x`

#### Wallet

These environment variables are used for the Apple Wallet implementation:

- `WALLET_PASS_TYPE_IDENTIFIER`: Use the same value supplied when setting up your Pass Type ID. It should start with `pass.`, e.g. `pass.com.apple.devpubs.example`
- `WALLET_TEAM_IDENTIFIER`: Your iOS developer account team identifier, e.g., `A93A5CM278`
- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_P12_BASE64`: The Base64 encoded contents of a PKCS #12 file containing your Pass Type ID private key and certificate. See below for instructions on how to obtain this. 
- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE`: The passphrase required to access the contents of the PKCS #12 file containing your Pass Type ID private key and certificate.
- `WALLET_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED`: Optional. Set to `false` to prevent the application from connecting to the APNs service. This can be useful for suppressing connecting failure exceptions when running unit tests with dummy values. If this value is missing or has any value other than `false` (case insensitive), the application will attempt to connect to APNs on startup. 

To obtain the value for WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_P12_BASE64, export your Pass Type ID certificate and corresponding private key as a `.p12` file.

The password you supply when you export should be set as the `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` environment variable.
 
Run this command to extract the value to set as the `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_P12_BASE64` environment variable, where `export.p12` is the name of the `.p12` file you exported:

    base64 -i export.p12 -o -
    
On Mac OS you can optionally pipe the output of this command to `pbcopy` to add the result to your clipboard.

If you need dummy values for unit testing purposes, you may use the values from the test class `au.gov.dto.dibp.appointments.wallet.PassBuilderTest`.

#### Other

- `SESSION_JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_BASE64`: 256-bit Base64 encoded encryption and signature key for storing the user's security context in a cookie
- `SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password for the read-only monitoring endpoints
- `ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID`: Analytics tracking ID, optional
- `PUBLIC_KEY_FINGERPRINT_BASE64_1` and `PUBLIC_KEY_FINGERPRINT_BASE64_2`: Base64 encoded SHA-256 fingerprints of the Subject Public Key Information (SPKI) in the public key certificate and the backup certificate signature request for the public host, used for [HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Security/Public_Key_Pinning), optional, but both must be present to activate HPKP
- `HPKP_REPORT_URI_ENFORCED`: URI for web browsers to send reports on HPKP violations for enforced policies, optional 
- `HPKP_REPORT_URI_REPORT_ONLY`: URI for web browsers to send reports on HPKP violations for report-only policies, optional 
- `CSP_REPORT_URI`: URI for web browsers to send reports on [Content Security Policy (CSP)](http://content-security-policy.com/) violations, optional 

##### Commands

Get fingerprint of public key certificate as a Base64 encoded SHA-265 digest of the DER formatted Subject Public Key Info (SPKI): 

    openssl x509 -pubkey -inform PEM -in certificate.pem -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64

### Running the application

To simply run the application:

    ./go startApp
    
You can optionally supply the port number to use as an environment variable:

    PORT=8080 ./go run

The port defaults to 8083. Use `PORT=0` to select a random port.

### Development

To run or debug the application from your IDE, use the `Application` class as the entry point.

### Build

To run the full build:

    ./go fullBuild

### Testing

To run unit tests:

    ./go test

To run integration tests:

    ./go integrationTest

To run all tests:

    ./go allTests

### Security checks
 
Check dependencies against known publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities published by NIST in NVD Data Feeds:

    ./go dependencyCheck --info

### Other

To view other build tasks:

    ./go tasks
